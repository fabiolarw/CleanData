# CleanData
"Getting and Cleaning Data" Course Project of the "Data Science Specialization" by Johns Hopkins at Coursera.

This project is based on wearable computing data, specifically on data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone by the Machine Learning group at University of California, Irvine.

A full description of the research is available at the site where the data was obtained:

The data used was can be found in:

The script presents a unique tidy data set with the information previously stated, after doint the following cleaning of the data: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. FinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
